A deployable, modular solution framework for Platform Engineers to package, deploy, and evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) on Red Hat OpenShift AI 3.0.

== 👋 Welcome

Welcome to the **Automated Multilingual Evaluation Pipeline (AMEP)** solution kit.

If you are a **Platform Engineer**, you know the struggle: your AI Developers and Data Scientists want to use the "latest and greatest" open-source models, but they need to know if those models actually work for your specific business requirements—especially when supporting multiple languages.

This solution is designed to help you solve the "Paradox of Choice." It provides the architectural plumbing to turn ad-hoc model guessing into a standardized engineering process.

[NOTE]
.A Modular Framework
====
This solution is broken down into **four distinct, manual phases**. This design allows you to understand exactly how the components interact, debug easily, and reuse individual modules in your own custom workflows.

== 🎯 Who Is This For?

We built this specifically for the people building atoken generation platform used to build Gen AI powered applications:

* **Platform Engineers (Primary):** You need to provide a robust service to your Gen AI development teams. This guide shows you how to build the infrastructure for model evaluation.
* **Service Consultants:** You are delivering OpenShift AI solutions to customers. Use this kit as a reference architecture or a base for your delivery engagements.
* **Red Hat Partners:** You are building integrations on top of OpenShift AI 3.0. This framework demonstrates practices for using RHOAI Model Registry, Packaging Models in ModelCar, and using TrustyAI LM_Eval integration.

== 🧩 The Solution Framework

The solution is divided into four sequential phases. You can run them in order to build the full pipeline, or use them independently.

=== Phase 1: Package & Register 📦
**"Treat Models Like Software"** +
Stop downloading weights at runtime. We show you how to package an LLM into an OCI container image (a "ModelCar") using `podman`. You will then register this artifact in the **OpenShift AI Model Registry** for governance and versioning.

=== Phase 2: Deploy (vLLM) 🚀
**"High-Performance Serving"** +
Manually trigger the deployment of your registered model using **vLLM**, the state-of-the-art inference engine. You will configure the `ServingRuntime` and ensure GPU resources are allocated correctly.

=== Phase 3: Evaluate (TrustyAI) ⚖️
**"The Test Drive"** +
Deploy a **TrustyAI LMEval_Job**—a Kubernetes Custom Resource that automatically runs standardized fluency tests against your deployed model.
* **Languages Tested:** English 🇺🇸, Spanish 🇪🇸, Japanese 🇯🇵
* **Metrics:** Accuracy, Fluency, and Hallucination resistance.

=== Phase 4: Visualize 📊
**"Make It Visible"** +
Gather raw JSON data from object storage (S3) and use a Jupyter Notebook to generate a **Radar Chart**. This provides a clean visual artifact to show stakeholders exactly how different models compare.

== 🛠️ Tech Stack

This solution utilizes standard, cloud-native components available in OpenShift AI 3.0:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Component | Role

|**Model Registry**
|Central catalog for tracking ModelCar versions and metadata.

|**vLLM**
|High-performance inference engine (via KServe) for serving models.

|**TrustyAI**
|Executes the `lm-evaluation-harness` to metricize performance.

|**S3 Storage**
|Stores evaluation datasets and resulting metrics (ODF/MinIO).

|**Jupyter**
|Provides the interactive dashboard for result analysis.
|===

== 🚀 Prerequisites

Before starting Phase 1, ensure you have the following:

* [ ] Access to an **OpenShift AI 3.0+** cluster.
* [ ] **Cluster Admin** privileges (required for setting up initial ServingRuntimes).
* [ ] **S3 Storage** credentials (bucket name, endpoint, access key, secret key).
* [ ] A **Container Registry** (Quay.io or internal) to push your ModelCar images.
